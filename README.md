# OpenDiS File Reader
File reader for the file format used in the [OpenDiS](https://github.com/OpenDiS/OpenDiS) [example](https://github.com/OpenDiS/OpenDiS/blob/main/examples/10_strain_hardening/180chains_16.10e.data).

## Description
This modifier is under development.

Currently, the file reader is somewhat limitedâ€”it works for this file and others that follow the same schema, but it might not work for all files generated by OpenDis. This is mostly because I haven't had the opportunity to work with OpenDis myself; I've only looked at this specific file to understand the meaning of each row or value.

There is one significant limitation to note: the OVITO Python interface currently does not support the creation of dislocation networks in the same way the DXA modifier does. Therefore, this file reader interprets the "nodes" as particles and the "dislocation lines" or "arms" as lines. We are working to overcome this limitation.

For mor information and an example see this [discussion](https://github.com/OpenDiS/OpenDiS/issues/3).

## Parameters 
[[Function parameters]]

## Example
The example in the examples directory was created with OVITO 3.11.0 (currently under development), which can be obtained from [here](https://ovito.org/development_builds/).

## Installation
- OVITO Pro [integrated Python interpreter](https://docs.ovito.org/python/introduction/installation.html#ovito-pro-integrated-interpreter):
  ```
  ovitos -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/ovito-org/OpenDiSFileReader.git
  ``` 
  The `--user` option is recommended and [installs the package in the user's site directory](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/user_guide/#user-installs).

- Other Python interpreters or Conda environments:
  ```
  pip install git+https://github.com/ovito-org/OpenDiSFileReader.git
  ```
